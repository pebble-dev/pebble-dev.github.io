Almost nine years ago, when what was to become Rebble began to emerge from
the ashes of Pebble Technology, Corp., [David stated a goal for the
project](https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html) to "bring
the many disparate (Pebble preservation) efforts under a single banner,
concentrating energy and enthusiasm to maximize the likelihood of
continuance and resurgence of Pebble as a platform."  It's hard to believe
it's been that long -- and it's hard to believe that it's already been 8
months since Google [released the original firmware source
code](https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html), and [Pebble
founder Eric Migicovsky formed a new company, Core Devices](https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches)
... it seems that the "resurgence" that we imagined has truly come to
fruition!

It's a really lovely moment to take a breath and take a look at how far
we've come.  We're incredibly proud to have delivered on the promise of
"continuance" for these nine years -- for longer than Pebble Technology
Corporation itself, in fact!  -- and to have evolved along the way from a
loose collection of co-conspirators, to Rebble Alliance, LLC, to our current
non-profit Rebble Foundation.  It has been a delight and an honor to get to
serve you -- the Pebble community -- for all these years, and to have made
good on our promise to keep the dream alive for our favorite little watches.

And it's also exciting moment to look forward to how Rebble and Core Devices
can partner together in a future for the Pebble ecosystem, and to come up
with some new promises for you going forward!  So for more on how we're
working with Core Devices, how we plan to continue to serve you, and how you
can get involved, read on...

# Core 🧡 Rebble

The awesome developer community that continue to build [apps and
watchfaces](https://apps.rebble.io) for Pebbles today are what makes Pebble,
Pebble.  In a world where the legacy Pebble app (just about) hangs on, Core
Devices are producing new watches running on their app -- and in the mean
time, other open source apps are being built by community members (hey, a little
more on that in a moment!).  Fragmentation is a possiblity that
would result in a less than stellar experience for everyone -- which is why
we're super excited to announce that we've partnered with Core Devices to
use the Rebble app store back end on Core watches.

For now, Core Devices's [new appstore](https://apps.repebble.com) is a
continuation of the legacy Pebble appstore, from the same lineage as
Rebble's -- and Core Devices and Rebble have agreed to use Rebble Web
Services as the singular backend.  This means that any apps developers
upload or update through the [Rebble Developer
Portal](https://dev-portal.rebble.io) will appear in both appstores!  How
neat is that?  We've also started on a long list of improvements to these
services which will continue to be pushed out over the coming weeks -- some
will be minor bugfixes, others more exciting features.

Because Rebble doesn't produce revenue from hardware sales like Core does,
and we're not requiring that Core users have a Rebble subscription, we've
made it work by agreeing that Core will pay us a reasonable amount to cover
our costs and to support the maintenance of Rebble Web Services.  Our
agreement with Core is non-exclusive; if anyone else wants to build PebbleOS
hardware and use the Rebble app store, hit us up and we'd love to get you in
on the app store, too!

So -- **if you are using the new Core Devices app, you do not _need_ a
Rebble Subscription** to use the app store.  If you wish to use Bobby (once
support is added for the new Core Devices app), you _will_ need to have an
active subscription.  And we hope you'll continue to have one anyway -- more
on that in a moment.

# Our promise to you

As Core and other vendors start to produce hardware for RebbleOS, we were
worried that the ecosystem may begin to fragment.  This is one of the
reasons that we worked so hard to partner with Core on a unified app store. 
Access to legacy apps, apps developed since the shutdown and submitted via
our [dev portal](https://dev-portal.rebble.io/), and new apps created
through
[hackathons](https://makezine.com/article/electronics/rebble-strikes-back-with-nonprofit-hackathon-and-os-ambitions/)
and other efforts should be guaranteed for all devices.  And we haven't
forgotten why we're all here -- nine years ago, a company that built things
that we love blinked out of existence, and a community, rather than a
company, came together to keep supporting them.

So we've been working on distilling Rebble Foundation's mission, and what
our responsibility is going forward.  So far, what we've come up with is
something like this:

> Rebble Foundation's mission is to support, promote, and advocate for
> small, low-power, open-source, user-respecting smartwatches, and to foster
> a community around them.  Rebble Foundation wants both to do this today,
> and to be able to do this long into the future, without depending on
> support from any particular external entity -- Rebble Foundation's primary
> responsibility is to the users and community that it supports.

We think that it's OK if we work with partners to meet this goal, including
device manufacturers like Core -- and, for that matter, it's OK if this is a
little fluid, if it means that we branch into other user-respecting families
of devices and technologies[^1].  But our responsibility to our users means
that we have to be advocates for technologies that will outlast current
manufacturers -- and, for that matter, that could even outlast Rebble
Foundation!

[^1] What do we mean by user-respecting?  Roughly, we think that a
technology is user-respecting if it puts the needs of the user, not the
needs of the manufacturer or developer, first.  By way of examples that are
informative, but not by any means complete: user-respecting technology does
not demand or optimize for a user's engagement unless it genuinely helps
that individual user; it does not create or remove features unless doing so
directly helps a user, rather than helping a manufacturer.  If a
user-respecting technology processes a user's data, it does so only in a way
that helps that user, and it does not transmit a user's data to any other
party without a user's consent.

Our promise to you is that we'll do our darned best to keep our eye on this
goal, and to work towards it the best we know how.  We owe our existence to
you, the community, that cares so much about these watches, and that has
trusted us to continue that work over the past nine years, and it's our job
to fight on your behalf to make sure that a community can continue to care
about little friendly pieces of hardware long into the future.

# Reinvesting in Rebble

Right back at the start, we never could have imagined the success that 
our subscription service would
end up experiencing, and that income has been incredibly helpful in keeping
the lights (and cloud/servers) on — when Katharine and David originally did
the math, they expected that they would personally have to chip in a hundred
bucks a month or so to help subsidize the few dozen subscribers we expected! 
A few hours after our soft launch of [Rebble Web
Services](https://rebble.io/2018/02/15/rebble-web-services.html), we
realized that we Rebble might be able to sustain itself after all.  Over the
past nine (!!) years, we've built up a small cushion of cash, and it seems
like a good time to reinvest in Rebble going forward.

We're excited to say that we've just this morning gotten a bid back from a
group that we're really excited to work with on getting [our mobile app,
Cobble](https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app) across the finish line to
something that's a beautiful and functional app that you all will want to
use on an every day basis -- for PebbleOS devices past and future.

All of the work that we've done to continue the Pebble ecosystem has been
open source because we believe that, together, we can build a Pebble future
that we love -- and it's paid off in spades (for instance, Maxim's [Timeline
support](https://rebble.io/2019/07/24/its-timeline-time.html) contribution
was possible only because Rebble Web Services are open source!).  We think
that the Pebble community deserves a first-class open source mobile app that
we can have ownership of, and that we can maintain long into the future --
so we think it's a no brainer to spend our resources to make that happen.

We've also recently been working on using our resources to get the open
source PebbleOS release up and running on legacy Pebble Technology Corp
watches.  We engaged the services of Codecoup -- the maintainers of NimBLE
-- to help us find a handful of bugs in our implementation of Bluetooth on
legacy watches, and once we have a moment to breathe, we're looking forward
to getting back to work on that project!

# Rebble needs you!

We have a lot of things we're working on, but one thing we wanted to be
clear on is: **Rebble (still!) needs you!**

Here are three ways you can help that would make a huge difference.

**Contribute to Rebble!**  We have so many exciting projects going on!  Are
you excited about designing the future of the app store, or helping to make
Cobble beautiful?  Would you like to hone your back-end development skills
in building paths to submit to the Rebble app store directly from the Pebble
SDK?  Do you have features that you want to add to Bobby?  These are all
things that would make a big difference, and it's way easier to get started
than you might think.

**Run to be on the Board of Directors!**  Rebble is a large community of
enthusiasts and contributors of all kinds, but the Rebble Foundation is run
by a Board of Directors, right now consisting of
Will, [Joshua](https://www.joshuawise.com/), and
[David](https://ishjr.com/).  These seats are staggered to ensure
continuity, and we have a seat opening up soon.  Are you interested in
helping guide the future of Rebble -- or do you know someone who is?  We'll
be holding elections soon, and we're looking for nominees -- please nominate
yourself (or a friend!) by [sending the Board an
e-mail](mailto:board@rebble.foundation) with your name, a sentence or two
about why you'd like to be on the Board, and a sentence or two about how you
think you could contribute.  (Although it would be great to have someone
with non-profit leadership experience join the Board, the only hard
requirement is that you're excited about serving the Rebble community!)

**Continue your Rebble subscription!**  We have a lot of work that we want
to do to continue to serve you.  We don't sell hardware, and all of our
software is free and open source, so subscriptions and our app store
whitelabel agreement are our only source of revenue.  If you wiant to support
the Rebble Foundation's goal of ensuring the longevity of the Pebble
ecosystem in an accessible and user-respecting manner, then please consider
continuing your subscription.

# Thank you, thank you, thank you

That's about it for now, but you can expect to hear more soon, and more
frequent blog posts as our activities accelerate.  Thanks for joining us in
these past nine years.  It's you that's made it worth doing this.  We look
forward to being involved in the next exciting decade of little joyous
smartwatch evolution with you!

Your Rebble Board of Directors --

David, Joshua, and Will
