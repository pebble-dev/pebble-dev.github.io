Today, December 9th, is Rebble Day – the 9th anniversary of the [official birth of Rebble](https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html) -- and what better way to celebrate than by sharing the latest evolution of our developer community? I vividly remember the original Pebble forums, where I received help, became inspired, and even began friendships that still endure today.  We've spent the past decade primarily organizing and socializing on Discord ([hey, come join us!](https://rebble.io/discord)), but I have to say, there is something to be said for classic discussion forums.  Sure, it was a simpler time back then, but that doesn’t mean that slower, linear, searchable discussions have to be a thing of the past: as the Pebble developer community keeps growing, we've been thinking: wouldn't it be nice to get all of the knowledge that we've all assembled into one place that was designed to last?  That's why **we're excited to announce today the launch of the new Rebble dev forum** -- [forum.rebble.io](https://forum.rebble.io)!

The forum is a place to learn from others, get help, discuss hardware old and new, [show off your latest watchfaces and apps](https://forum.rebble.io/c/showcase/3), collaborate on smartstraps (still my favourite!), and, most importantly, [post pics of pets](https://forum.rebble.io/t/post-picture-of-your-pets/93)! The forums have only been live (with no promotion until now) for about a week, and already we have dozens of users sharing over a hundred posts across more than fifty topics.

One of the coolest features is our appstore integration – since the forum login is based on your Rebble/Rebble developer account, you can [share your detailed appstore listing](https://forum.rebble.io/t/watchapp-bobby-by-rebble/111) in the forums and get feedback, encouragement, organize beta testing, and more! In fact, **each new or updated app automatically gets its own forum post**:

and each appstore listing now contains a link back to its own forum thread so that your users can chat and cheer you on!

We’ve seen some really great interactions happening already, such as in [irek’s Naïve watchface thread](https://forum.rebble.io/t/watchface-naive/137) where they’ve been sharing updates, coordinating betas, receiving encouragement, and making fun connections. 

I've been constantly impressed with how amazing our community has been on Discord, with some the smartest and kindest people that I've seen all in one place, teaching and learning and sharing.  It's been amazing to see dozens of developers already starting to share tips, solve problems, and collaborate on the new Rebble dev forum -- why not take a moment to [stop in and say hi](https://forum.rebble.io/)?  And of course, don’t forget to [share what’s on your wrist](https://forum.rebble.io/t/whats-on-your-wrist/119)!
