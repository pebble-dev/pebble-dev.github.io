Hello, hello!  Joshua here, with some exciting news.  @ishotjr and I were
chatting some recently, and we've been super excited by some of the
things that people have been working on in Discord.  We were wondering to
ourselves: what can we do to make it even *more* exciting to contribute? 
Well, we took a look at the Rebble Alliance's books, and we're happy to
announce something new: Rebble Grants!

[Rebble
Grants](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSc7bON6zaQq7dtAeq9Ux3yq2nCITCbG2cd1aCmtq4K-iO8w/viewform)
are our new plan to reinvest some of the proceeds from running the Rebble
Web Services into development that keeps Pebble watches -- and the Rebble
service!  -- running well into the future.  We've been saving up a little
money over the past few years (!) of running the service (more on that in
["The Shiny Rebble
Future"](https://rebble.io/2019/07/29/the-shiny-rebble-future.html#money),
from last year), and we've allocated $25,000 to fund all kinds of things
that might make the world a little better for Rebblers!  Some of the things
we hope to fund are:

  * work on a replacement mobile app for Pebble;
  * development on the RebbleOS firmware replacement project;
  * design work that supports the Rebble Alliance's goals;
  * new features for Rebble Web Services; and
  * development on new watchapps or watchfaces.

Of course, if you want to do something that you think fits within our
general goals, but that we didn't list above, please let us know and we'll
tell you if it's a match!  We're looking to fund all different sizes of
projects, big to small; we'll offer funding proportional to the importance
of the proposal to the Rebble Alliance's goals, and of course proportional
to the amount of work that it'll be to do it.  Remember that you can submit
multiple grants, so you can decide whether you want to go big right away, or
whether you want to break things up into phases.

If you're ready, you can [submit a grant
proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSc7bON6zaQq7dtAeq9Ux3yq2nCITCbG2cd1aCmtq4K-iO8w/viewform)
starting right now!  And if you just want to chat about it, we're here for
you -- come talk to @joshua or @ishotjr on
[Discord](https://rebble.io/discord).

We're super excited to be launching this -- we're thrilled about getting to
invest more in Pebble into the future, and we love the idea of kickstarting
a new wave of Pebble development.  We're looking forward to seeing what you
come up with!
