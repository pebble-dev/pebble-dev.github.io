			<h2> Developer VM</h2>

			<p class="bio">
				There are a few ways to <a href="https://help.rebble.io/sdk" target="_blank"> install the Pebble SDK </a>. You'll need Python 2 and a bit of patience, but it's fairly straightforward.
				<br>
				We suggest a native install, but you might find it easier to use a prebuilt virtual machine.

				<br>
				The Rebble Hackathon VM is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and comes with the SDK preinstalled, as well as VSCode and firefox with some useful bookmarks.
				<br><br>
				You can download the VM here, it's around 7Gb.

				<br>
				Use your favourite hypervisor to load the .vmdk file. Virtualbox is one free option.
