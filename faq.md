## Rebble

### Where is the FAQ?

Well, right here! At least, for frequently asked questions about *The Rebble Alliance*. For frequently asked questions about how to use the Rebble Web Services with your Pebble smartwatch, head to [howto](/howto) and scroll down.

### What is Rebble?

Rebble began as a supplement to the [official Pebble documentation](https://developer.pebble.com/).

### What does Rebble do?

Our present focus is on replacing key pieces of the Pebble ecosystem: the appstore and related web services, and later on down the road, potentially even firmware and mobile apps.  At a higher level, our goal is to maintain and advance Pebble functionality, in the absence of *Pebble Technology Corp*.
