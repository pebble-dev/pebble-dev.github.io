  bio: "I have a lot of energy and motivation and tend to find myself at the center of projects like this (see also e.g. <a href=\"https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/579841731482cdda2b000061\">Pokemon GO Radar</a>).  I enjoy bringing people together, harnessing enthusiasm, fostering teams, and building amazing things.<br>  <a href=\"https://github.com/jneubrand\">@jneubrand</a> and I started the <a href=\"https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki\">wiki</a>/<a href=\"https://github.com/pebble-dev\">org</a> that eventually mutated to become <a href=\"http://rebble.io/\">Rebble</a>. :heart: to everyone else who's joined in since - what we're going to accomplish here is mind-blowing! :bowtie:"

  bio: "I'm a high school student, software developer and network security enthusiast. I mostly do projects that benefit me and others in my free time, I mostly do Android programming and other languages such as Python or Go. I maintain an <a href=\"http://github.com/konradit/goprowifihack\">unofficial GoPro WiFi API</a>, extend camera functionality via <a href=\"http://github.com/konradit/autoexechack\">Automated scripts for GoPro cameras</a> and several Android apps. I tried several smartwatches and I can finally say that Pebble rocks, I know it, you know it, everybody knows it! I joined Rebble to help maintaining Pebble alive, and I encourage you do the same. My role is front-end website, firmware and Android app development."

  bio: "I originally joined the Pebble Dev Community Discord to thank the remaining team members for such a wonderful product. What I found was a passionate and empowered community looking to salvage and maintain whatever they could of the great Pebble Legacy. It was at that point that I suggested that everyone working on archiving and rebuilding group together in a team, then known as \"#rebirth\". From there we've grouped together and are working on not just keeping our Pebbles running, but making them more than they were. I can't wait to see where Rebble takes us next!<br>My main skills lie in server management, general tech support, community management and customer services."
