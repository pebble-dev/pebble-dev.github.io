My role is front-end website, firmware and Android app development."

  bio: "I originally joined the Pebble Dev Community Discord to thank the remaining team members for such a wonderful product. What I found was a passionate and empowered community looking to salvage and maintain whatever they could of the great Pebble Legacy. It was at that point that I suggested that everyone working on archiving and rebuilding group together in a team, then known as \"#rebirth\". From there we've grouped together and are working on not just keeping our Pebbles running, but making them more than they were. I can't wait to see where Rebble takes us next!<br>My main skills lie in server management, general tech support, community management and customer services."

I was amazed that everything still worked like the day the watch launched, and by how welcoming and helpful the community was, even 4 years after Pebble's \"death\". Graphic design is my passion, and most of my work has been dedicated to creating a companion app to replace the aging official one, as well as icons to be used anywhere from Rebble OS to the web!"
