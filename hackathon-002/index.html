			<h1> FAQ </h1>
			<h2> What is this? </h2>
			<p> 
				A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>! A week where Pebble enthusiasts can get together (virtually) and build something cool for the Pebble platform.
			</p>

			<h2> Why? </h2>
			<p> 
				The first hackathon was all about fun. This time we're doing it again, but building up PebbleOS too! We'd love to see some new apps on the store, new functionality for the watches, or old developers getting back into building watchfaces.

				Given the complexity of working with PebbleOS, this time we're doing it for a week straight!
			</p>

			<h2> How do I get involved? </h2>
			<p> 
				All you have to do is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe54I926xxlj_65w-Gl712O0NjClye9dT_kcZlAgsdTC8mPQw/viewform?usp=dialog">fill out this form</a>, then <a href="/discord">join us on Discord</a> during the hackathon week! We'll have dedicated channels where you can ask questions and see what other people are up to.
			</p>

			<h2> Do I have to join in all week? </h2>
			<p> 
				Absolutely not! Many people will only join in for parts of the weekend. If you want to dive into RebbleOS, you might need more time, but come along for as long as you want.
			</p>

			<h2> How do I setup the SDK? </h2>
			<p> 
				The Pebble SDK is old, the quickest way is use the <a href="./vm">official hackathon VM image</a>. It's about 7GB, so you'll want to be sure to get it set up in advance. For alternative installation instructions (including a native install), <a href="https://help.rebble.io/sdk">see here.</a>
			</p>

			<h2> How long is the event? </h2>
			<p> 
				1 week! We'll start on the 1st of March, and finish on the 9th. You don't need to be at your computer the entire time! Just work on your project when you can, and drop by on Discord to chat.
			</p>

			<h2> How do I submit my project? </h2>
			<p> 
				If you make a Watchface or Watch app that's ready to be published, please <a href="https://dev-portal.rebble.io">publish it to the Rebble appstore</a>. If you want to write up about your project, or if it's not something you want (or can) publish to the appstore, then submit it as a project to <a href="https://www.hackster.io/rebble/">our hackster community</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h2> I don't know how to code, can I still get involved? </h2>
			<p> 
				Sure! Jump on the Discord server and see if anyone else needs help. You could always make some artwork, logos, or designs etc.
			</p>

			<h2> What's this about stickers? </h2>
			<p> 
				Anyone who uploads an app to the appstore during the hackathon weekend (or immediately after it) can receive free Rebble stickers! We'll add more details once we get the first batch back from the printers.
